# How to install
There are 3 diferent ways: using the exe, normal instalation and virtualv instalation.
- People who don't want to use a Command Line Interface should get the exe instalation.
- Developers who prefer to use a single interpreter should get the normal instalation.
- Developers who doesn't want to have dependency problems and like to manage projects in sepparate virtual environment should get the virtualenv instalation.

_Note: normal and virtualenv instalation both need to have Python 3.6+ installed._

### Exe install
***Warning: this installation is being discussed and may be removed in next versions.***
1. Go to the [last release](https://github.com/sralloza/vcm/releases/latest) web page and download the zip file (`vcm.zip`)
2. Extract the zip whenever you want.
3. Run manually once the `vcm.exe` file (double click) inside the folder where you just extracted the zip.
    3.1. If you have moved the desktop folder outside the default, you need to copy `download.cmd` and `notify.cmd` from `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\desktop` to your real desktop folder. If you haven't moved the desktop folder, you don't have to do this step.
4. You will have 2 new files in the desktop, `download.cmd` and `notify.cmd`. The first one is the downloader, and the second one is the notificator.
5. You need to set-up the settings. To do that, change the files `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vcm-settings.toml` and `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vcm-credentials.toml`. See [Settings File](#settings-file) and [Credential File](#credentials-file) for more info.


### Virtualenv install
1. Create a folder whenever you want.
2. Inside that folder we will create the virtual environment. To do so, open the terminal and type `virtualenv venv`.
3. Activate the environment using `call venv/scripts/activate.bat`.
4. Install the program with `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/sralloza/vcm.git@dev`
5. Inside that folder, create another folder and add it to the `PATH`. If you don't know how to add folders to the `PATH`, visit [this site](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html).
6. Finally, create a file named `vcm.cmd` in that

```
@echo off
"drive:/path/to/your/folder/venv/scripts/python.exe" %*
```
7. Done. To use the program, type `vcm -h`


### General install
1. Run `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/sralloza/vcm.git@dev`
2. Done. To use the program, just type `vcm -h`

# How to use
Al execute the program for the first time, the settings and credential files will be automatically created. You can find them in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vcm-settings.toml` and `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vcm-credentials.toml`.

## Settings File
The settings file path is `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vcm-settings.toml`. It's written in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#toml)

It has 3 sections: general, download and notify.

### General section
Settings:
* **root-folder** - Path to the folder where the files will be downloaded. It will be used to store other files, as logs, notify database, filecache json and others. Must be set, it lacks of a default value.
* **logging-level** - Logging level. Can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` or `CRITICAL`. Defaults to `INFO`.
* **timeout** - Number of seconds without response before abandoning download attempt. Defaults to 30.
* **retries** - Number of attempts to download a web page before raising an error. Defaults to 10.
* **exclude-urls** - List of urls to exclude while downloading. It's designed to allow the user to avoid downloading files from first quarter's subjects while cursing second quarter.

### Download section
Settings:
* **forum-subfolders** - If true, all the files found inside a forum discussion will be stored in a sepparate folder. Defaults to true.
* **disable-section-indexing** - List of subject's urls that will have section indexing disabled.

### Notify section
Settings:
* **use-base64-icons** - If true, the icons will be sent as base64 data. If false, the icons will be sent as direct download links from google drive. Note that Gmail does not render base64 data. Defaults to false.
* **email** - Recipient of the notify email. Must be set, it lacks of a default value.

### Settings file example

***vcm-settings.toml***
```toml

root-folder = "/home/user/virtual-campus-data"
logging-level = "INFO"
timeout = 30
retries = 10
exclude-urls = [
    https://campusvirtual.uva.es/course/view.php?id=89712, # don't parse this subject
]

[download]
forum-subfolders = true
disable-section-indexing = [
    "https://campusvirtual.uva.es/course/view.php?id=16942", # comments
    "https://campusvirtual.uva.es/course/view.php?id=82645", # are
    "https://campusvirtual.uva.es/course/view.php?id=45651", # allowed
]

[notify]
use-base64-icons = false
email = "email@example.com"

```

## Credentials file
The credentials file path is `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vcm-credentials.toml`. It's written in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#toml).
**Note that the credentials will be stored in plain text.**

It has 2 sections: VirtualCampus and Email.
All settings must be set, there are no default values.

### VirtualCampus section
Settings:
* **username** - Username of the virtual campus.
* **password** - Password of the virtual campus.

* **smtp_port** - stmp port. For Gmail is 587


## Command Line Interface arguments
There are 3 commands: download, notify and settings.

Arguments:
- `-v`, `--version` - Prints the current version and exits.
- `-nss`, `--no-status-server` - Disables the status server. See [During the Execution](#during-the-execution) for more info.

Note: place the general arguments before the command.
Example: `vcm --no-status-server download --nthreads 23 --no-killer`

To see more info use `vcm -h` or `vcm --help`

### Download command
It downloads all the virtual campus files in the root folder.

Arguments:
* `--nthreads NTHREADS` - Select the number of threads to use. Default value is 20.
* `--no-killer` - Disables the Killer thread
* `-d`, `--debug` - Opens Google Chrome in localhost after start. See [During the Execution](#during-the-execution) for more info.
* `-q`, `--quiet` - Disables stdout, so nothing gets printed.

To view the command help, use `vcm download -h` or `vcm download --help`.

### Notify command
It search all files in the virtual campus but it doesn't download them. Instead, it sends an email if there are new files, with a link to each new file. This is done using a local sqlite database stored in the root folder.

Arguments:
* `--nthreads NTHREADS` - Select the number of threads to use. Default value is 20.
* `--no-icons` - Disable the icons in the email.

Note: this command will not start the killer thread, because it's design to avoid using stdin and stdout, so it can be used with [tasks managers](#cron-integration-task-scheduler) like cron.

To view the command help, use `vcm notify -h` or `vcm notify --help`.

### Settings command
It can show or change settings.

Uses:
* **List all settings:** `vcm settings list`.
* **List one specific setting:** `vcm settings show <setting>`
* **List key settings (not values):** `vcm settings keys`
* **Set settings value:** `vcm settings set section.key value`.
    * *Section* is the settings section, can be one of `general`, `download` or `notify`.
    * *Key* is the settings key you want to change. It depends on the section.
    * *Value* is the settings value you want to set.
    * To view the comand help, use `vcm settings set -h` or `vcm settings set --help`.



## During the execution
During the execution you can open a web browser in localhost to access to real time information of the threading status. It is shown what is the state of each thread and what it's downloading each thread.

To view the status of a thread, a color code is used:
- Blue: thread is idle (ready to work).
- Green: thread downloading for less than 30 seconds.
- Orange: thread downloading between 30 seconds and 1 minute.
- Red: thread downloading between 1 minute and 1 and a half minutes.
- Magenta: thread downloading for more than 1 and a half minutes. The total time is shown in this case.
- Black: thread was killed (not working anymore, the program is closing).


## Cron integration (Task Scheduler)
VCM is designed to work with a task scheduler. Commands are:
* Download: `virtualenv/path/bin/python -m vcm -nss download -q`
* Notify: `virtualenv/path/bin/python -m vcm -nss notify`
